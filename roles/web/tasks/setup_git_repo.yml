# Make sure the sudoers file preserves the ability to use ssh forwarding.
# That way we don't need to store a private key on the server to get
# access to the git repository. Don't forget to add the key used by the
# git repository to your ssh-agent using ssh-add on the machine where you
# run the playbooks.

# The git module calls python's tempfile.mkstemp() which uses the TMPDIR
# environment variable. However this is set to /tmp which is mounted as
# noexec. As a result the git command will fail. The solution is to set
# TMPDIR to point to some other suitable location. Here we use /var/tmp
# but any suitable location will do.
